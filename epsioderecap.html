<p>
My favorite episode of the year is back and the magic is long overdue. 
</p>
<p>
The Dancing With the Stars Disney episode is here and “oh boy”, it was magical. Here is a recap of some of the notable dances of the night.
</p> 
<p>
<b>Carole Baskin and Pasha Pashkov: </b>
Shocker! Carole Baskin dances to The Lion King and I wish I could unsee it. <br>
Why is she still here? I sincerely apologize to Simba. This was offensive. <br>
Bruno Tonioli agreed. He said  ″I am stunned. I actually have never ever see a samba like this one. <br>
You just walked through it. Samba needs life, bounce, and energy. She just can't sleepwalk through a Samba.″ <br>
Rawr! <br> <b>Score: 12 out of 30</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Skai Jackson and Alan Bersten:</b>
I have no dancing expertise but I really do think Skai is a solid competitor. <br>
Last week she really messed up and was looking for a redemption. I thought it was a solid dance <br> 
to The Princess and The Frog “Almost There”. But the judges weren’t thrilled. She has potential and so their <br>
tough love is to push her. <br> <b>Score: 18 out of 30 </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Justina Machado and Sasha Farber: </b> Justina kills it every week. Her energy, spunk, and sass comes out into every dance. <br>
Justina performed a Charleston to ″Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious”. The judges critiqued her on some technicalities <br>
which brought down her score. However from the normal viewer, I thought it was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. <br>
<b>Score: 19 out of 30 </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Kaitlyn Bristowe and Artem Chigvintsev: </b>
Former Bachelorette seems to be following Hannah B’s lead as the front runner of the season. <br>
Kaitlyn performed the foxtrot to Moana’s “How Far I’ll Go”. Kaitlyn had poise and flowed stunningly. <br>
The judges called it the best dance of the night. <br>
<b>Score: 23 out of 30 </b>
<p>
<b>Nev Schulman and Jenna Johnson: </b>
My favorite dance of the night is host of Catfish, Nev. <br>
He danced Argentine tango to ″Angelica,″ from Pirates of the Caribbean. <br>
His characterization was spot-on and he embodied his character perfectly. Ahoy! <br>
<b>Score: 24 out of 30 (the highest of the season so far) </b>
