Clare Crawley is the worst Bachelorette to ever go onto the show. <br>
To start, I hated her on Bachelor In Paradise and on Winter Games. <br> 
She confuses knowing your worth to being disrespectful and arrogant. <br>
So truth be told, starting this season I wasn’t too excited. Yet, I was <br>
willing to give her a chance. When you sign up for the show, you know what <br>
you're signing up for. It is great to find love, that is the point after all, <br>
but she was disrespectful to every other man there. And, especially this <br>
season where they all dedicated more time and left their families during <br>
the pandemic, her disrespect is even more clear. However, I am so happy she’s <br>
gone. Bring on Tayshia!
