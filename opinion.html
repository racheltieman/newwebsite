<h2>The Bachelorette</h2>
Clare Crawley is the worst Bachelorette to ever go onto the show. 
To start, I hated her on Bachelor In Paradise and on Winter Games. 
She confuses knowing your worth to being disrespectful and arrogant. 
So truth be told, starting this season I wasn’t too excited. Yet, I was 
willing to give her a chance. When you sign up for the show, you know what 
you're signing up for. It is great to find love, that is the point after all, 
but she was disrespectful to every other man there. And, especially this 
season where they all dedicated more time and left their families during 
the pandemic, her disrespect is even more clear. However, I am so happy she’s 
gone. Bring on Tayshia!
